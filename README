Here are some raw materials on the way to allowing emacs to read and save
files at docs.google.com.  It's pretty messy at this point, but at least
I've sorted out which keys go into which slots for each phase of the
oauth protocol.  If you pick this up and press forward some more, let
me know how you make out.

Brief instructions:

create keys.el with setq's for *oauth_consumer_key* and
*oauth_consumer_secret* for your google credentials.  I did
early work with these set to "anonymous" and "anonymous", so you
might be able to get started that way.


(load "hmac-sha1.el")
(load "emacsg.el")
(load "keys.el")

(oauth1)
[this launches a browser for google login - pick up the verification key with the mouse]
(oauth2 "verificationkey")
(gdocs-list)

look in the buffer "last" and pick the docid of one of your documents -
edit it into the definition of (get-doc) in emacsg.el, then

(get-doc)

create an empty buffer called "new"

(conv)

look in the buffer "new"


the playground is very helpful:
